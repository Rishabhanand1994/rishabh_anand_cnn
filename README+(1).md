# Project Name
> Outline a brief description of your project.
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. 
It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma
 has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
